//! `sections` / `persons_sections`.
//!
//! `Section`/`SectionMetadata` (= `SectionV6`/`SectionMetadataV6`) implement `sqlx::FromRow`
//! directly (see their impls in `storage::project_storage::sections::current`) — a fetched
//! `Section` always has `sub_sections: vec![]`, `content: vec![]`, and empty
//! `metadata.authors`/`metadata.editors`, since a section's tree shape comes from multiple
//! rows, its author/editor list comes from a join, and its CRDT `content` never lives in
//! Postgres at all (stays on the filesystem, see `src/db/section_content.rs`). [`fetch_rows`]
//! fills in the tree shape via [`build_tree`] and [`fetch_links`] fills in authors/editors;
//! `content` is filled in separately by [`get_tree_for_project_with_content`] for the few
//! callers that need it. Because `FromRow` (not the compile-time-checked `query_as!` macro) is
//! what consumes these impls, the section-tree read query is runtime-checked.
//!
//! Known schema gap (inherited, not introduced here): `SectionMetadata.last_changed` has no
//! backing column (the migration that defined this schema already drops it, see
//! `db::data_migration::migrate_section`) — it always round-trips as `None`.
